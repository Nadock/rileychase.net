The modern web is a privacy nightmare, so I'll keep this simple; **this site is not tracking you**. There are **no** cookies, **no** ads, **no** Javascript, and no other tracking "features" on this website.

## Contact me

You can contact me with any questions, comments, feedback about this site's privacy stance at [privacy@rileychase.net](mailto:privacy@rileychase.net).

## Logging

To ensure the site is functioning correctly for all users we do collect server side usage logs. The hosting provider ([AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)) provides this logging functionality that records the following kinds of personal information about your usage of this site:

- The date & time of your access and what content you accessed.
- Which edge location you connected to.
- The IP address of your connection.
- Your `User-Agent` string.
- Additional, non-personally identifying information such as the HTTP version your browser is using.

For a more detailed explanations of all the fields CloudWatch provides please see the [AWS CloudFront Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/standard-logs-reference.html#BasicDistributionFileFormat) on this topic.

### What is an edge location?

An _edge location_ is one of many servers operated by AWS, spread all across the world. Each _edge location_ caches a copy of this website and by serving the website to you from an _edge location_ physically closer to you, this website loads faster.

By knowing which _edge location_ you connect to, it is possible to approximate your physical location. However, this approximation is only accurate to the nearest big city or national region. Because you are just one in millions of people within range of the same _edge location_, it is impossible to identify your location from this information alone.
