## My Professional Life :office_worker:

At work I'm a Software Engineer and I currently work for [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com), a very cool company that doesn't make desks.

If you're interested in my work life you should checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-taylor-chase/) or my [GitHub](https://github.com/nadock/) profile.

## Other Software Stuff :computer:

I tend to write a lot of software for random little things, most of which never leaves the safety of a private GitHub repository. However, I do have a couple of things you might be interested in checking out including [this website](https://github.com/Nadock/rileychase.net) and a [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Nadock/json_stringify) plugin.

## I Listen Music :headphones:

Like a lot, you might even like some of the songs I like. You can check out what I've been listening to recently on my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/riley1994) or [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/nadock) profiles.
