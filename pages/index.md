Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Right now there's not much here, but that might change in the future.

## My professional life :office_worker:

At work I'm a Software Engineer and I currently work for [Canva](https://www.canva.com), a very cool company that doesn't make canvases. If you're interested in my work life you should checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-taylor-chase/) or my [GitHub](https://github.com/nadock/) profile.

## Other software stuff :computer:

I tend to write a lot of software for random little things, most of which never leaves the safety of a private GitHub repository. However, I do have a couple of things you might be interested in checking out including [this website](https://github.com/Nadock/rileychase.net) and a [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Nadock/json_stringify) plugin.
